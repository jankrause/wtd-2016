# Improving API-Documentation with Meaningful Names

This repostory collects several patterns for specifiying API-operations. To find matching patterns for your operation, use the gitHub-search function the verb from the operations name, e.g. "send" from "sendMessage(...)". This approach uses the linguistic concept of [thematic grids and roles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_role) to improve the completeness of API-documentation.

  - [VerbNet](http://verbs.colorado.edu/~mpalmer/projects/verbnet.html) is the empirical basis of this approach and has been exteneded for its application to API-documentation.
  - [The basic approach](https://nats-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/pub/User/JanChristianKrause/SETP-10-Pub.pdf) is described in a research paper by Jan Christian.
  - [The empirical foundation](http://ediss.sub.uni-hamburg.de/volltexte/2014/7022/) can be found in Jan Christian's doctoral thesis (in german).
